Changes made:
1) Rather than using getters and setters for every variable, he can tell the point class to do the functionality. This way Point class has both state and behaviour.

If the class only has data members and no behaviour, it just becomes a data holder.
Using getters and setters is not ideal because it gives away how the data members are being implemented inside the class and also frequent changes to state(through setter function) can make the code inconsistent.

2)Removing DistanceAndCalculator class and calling calculateDistance and calculateDirection Function directly. 


So Shivam had just learned about OOP. He had written a program before that did two things,
- Find distance between two points
- Find direction (angle) between two points in Radians.

He has this code in the `org.procedural.DistanceAndDirectionCalculator` It looks like this for the reference - 

```java
public class DistanceAndDirectionCalculator {
    public static double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        double xDistance = x1 - x2;
        double yDistance = y1 - y2;
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(xDistance, 2) + Math.pow(yDistance, 2));
    }

    public static double direction(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        double xDistance = x2 - x1;
        double yDistance = y2 - y1;
        return Math.atan2(yDistance, xDistance);
    }
}
```
He thought it'll be a good idea to convert this to Object Oriented Programming. So he wrote a new implementation in package `org.oop`, he got 2 classes - 
- `org.oop.DistanceAndDirectionCalculator`
- `org.oop.Point`

However, his trainer told him that what he did is not Object Oriented programming and asked Shivam to try again. 
- Try to articulate problems with Shivam's OOP solution. (Write it somewhere and share it with your trainer)
- Fork the project and fix the design related problem with Shivam's OOP solution. Share that with your trainer too.
